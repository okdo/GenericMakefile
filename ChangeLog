	* Makefile: ver 0.2
	Fixed the bug not finding objects when multiple directories.
	Added ChangeLog.
	GPLed.
	Almost re-written to make it more easily usable:
	  no need to set <PROGRAM> (default: the directory name.)
	  no need to set <SRCDIRS> (default: current directory.)
	  no need to set <SRCEXTS> (default: all possible C/C++ types.)

	and more conventional:
	  substitute CFLAGS with MY_CFLAGS and LIBS with MY_LIBS so that
	    CFLAGS can still be used from the command line.
	  rebuild target removed.
	  make cleanall becomes make distclean.
	  -include becomes sinclude and protect when no source files.

	and others:
	  special dependency generating option (-MM -MP) for GCC compiler.
